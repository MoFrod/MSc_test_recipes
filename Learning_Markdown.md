## How to create headings
To create a heading we need to start a lne with a # followed by a space. Sub-headings can be created by using two hashes, eg ##. Several levels of headings can be created by adding more hashes.

To start a new paragraph we need to press enter twice. 

To Italisize text we ad an asterisk on each side of the text, for example, *this test should be italisized*

By adding two asterisks on each side the text will be renderd as bold: **This text should be bold**

***By adding three asterisks on each side of the text, the text will be displayed as bold and italisized.***

Blockquotes are created by adding > in front of every line of he block, followed by a space eg.
> This is a block quote
> Every line starts ith a > symbol followed by a space
> > This line started with two > symbols followed by a space.
